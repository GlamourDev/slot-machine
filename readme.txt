It's a fully functioning slot machine built with JavaScript. Reel animations created with velocity.js which is the only library being used.

Whole script file is full of comments, which describes the logic behind this project.

It includes sound effect on the winning spree. CSS perspective transformation for the reel 3D look. 

Class helper functions also included for the seamless scalability. 

Reel is a long stripe in SVG format.

On halfway through I realized that I should've used React for it's great component design and states.

Best viewed in 'Full' mode, although it is slightly responsive.
